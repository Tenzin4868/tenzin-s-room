            <div><h2>01 Laurel Schwulst - My Website is a Shifting House
            </h2></div>
            <p>A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is a computer that’s always connected to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website. Usually you have to pay for a server. You also have to pay for a domain name, which is an understandable piece of language that points to an IP. An IP is a string of numbers that is an address to your server. I totally agreed with this explanining of website because she mentioned it very clear and easy to understand. I also sometimes have thought about what's the nice and good meaining of website.</p>
            <P>It’s healthy to acknowledge today’s web is much different than the web many of us grew up using. So when they ask how to make a website (despite having already “learned”), they are alluding to the technological friction and social pressures that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018.</P>
            <div><h2>02 J.R. Carpenter - A Handmade Web
            </h2></div>
            <p>Inmagine back in the day if you have or if you can make handmade website which I will think really cool. Because back in the day when internet was new in this world, people don't own their own identities by having their own websites, instead being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." So, after learning how to code from this class, now I can easily say I can make hamdmade web too.</p>
            <div><h2>03 Ursula K. Le Guin - A Rant on Technology
            </h2></div>
            <p>Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or, as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment.Technology is the active human interface with the material world. Technology isnt just hi-tech it is a way that humans can communicate, we as a society have been so desensitized to tech that we think that anything less than a computer is not considered tech. </p>
            <div><h2>04 Taeyoon Choi - Hello World!
            </h2></div>
            <P>Like he mentioned in the website "In fact, we get the term “computer” from the forgotten practice of human computation. Well before computers became “personal,” an entire profession of arithmetic labor (mostly women) were contracted for scientific and military production." Back in 2019 I try to build my first-ever custome gaming pc. I watched lots of youtube video and learn how to build pc by myself using internet or technology. Just building a pc is not easy for me. even though I have lots of resources. I am assuming that back in 2011 builidng a computer is way more harder to build pc.</P>
            <div><h2>05 Callum Copley - A Friend is Writing
            </h2></div>
            <p>In this is very interesting for me beacuse it's not just a normal webiste. It's more like interative site. You click one place and read about it and more ideas and places pop up, creating an endless supply and chain of information. This site feels very candid in the way you explore and read, you lead yourself through what you want to read and aren't just being force fed information. It makes the web feel a bit more human, understanding your emotions and interests.</p>
            <div><h2>06 Frank Chimero - The Webs Grain
            </h2></div>
            <p>Well, first of all that sound makes me feel very annoying and like it said when listening to that sound and paying attention to my chest it feels somethings not right in my bosy. But on other hand addiing or having a sound in your website will make your site more realist or unique. Like for example; you are creating a website for envoriment and if you add some natural sound or some sommth music when people visit your website, it will make sit more realist and interesting.</p>
            <div><h2>07 Mindy Seu - The Poetry of Tools
            </h2></div>
            <p>I really enjoyed looking through all of these works! It felt like looking at a little gallery,like each site have they own meaning and and styles. I really like regeneration topic because it says Technology can give new life to old works by preserving it and making it accessible. The original works shown here were experimental at the time through the anticipation or use of new technology (that is now old). Updating them with our current technology can honor their original intention: to push against the boundaries of form and media. Which I think I am doing right now. Creating a old website to a new and fresh life by using my skills.</p>
